# Dog-Duty
This application is currently deployed on https://dogduty.herokuapp.com/
<br>
<br>
This application is used to keep a family or group of caretakers informed about the activities of their pet. For example, users can log when the pet has gone to the bathroom, eaten, been fed its medicine, and more. Users also have the capability to see the pet's logged duty history. This application was created using Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. This project has been deployed but is currently only connected to one central database. In the future, I am planning to add functionality such that multiple users can log on, join a family, and track their pet's do-abouts.
